# This js utility simply could be use to replace a specific word from names multiple folders. 

Eg. folders names - 1. ayush_www 
                    2. ayush_123 
                    3. ayush_coding   

Replacing the word 'ayush' with 'anexas'

New folders names - 1. anexas_www 
                    2. anexas_123 
                    3. anexas_coding  
                    
# How to use - create a folder and place all the folders which require a name change in it, copy the files from this repository to that folder and and make changes in the index.js according to the word you want to replace. Then run npm install and just run the rename.bat file.
